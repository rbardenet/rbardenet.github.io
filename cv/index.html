        <p> 
        In a nutshell, I obtained my Ph.D. in November 2012 from <a
        href="http://www.u-psud.fr/en/"> University
        Paris-Sud</a>, France, working with <a href="https://users.lal.in2p3.fr/kegl/">
	Bal&aacute;zs K&eacute;gl</a> on Monte Carlo methods and
        Bayesian optimization, applied to particle
        physics and machine learning. In particular, I was a member of the <a
        href="http://www.auger.org"> Pierre Auger</a>
        collaboration.
        </p>
        <p> Then I joined <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes">
        Chris Holmes'</a> group at the University
        of Oxford, UK, to work as a postdoc on Markov chain Monte Carlo for tall
        data. Since then, I am also working on applications to
        computational biology within the <a
        href="http://www.2020science.net"> 2020 science</a> network,
        of which I am now an emeritus fellow.
        </p>
        <p>
        I started at <a href="www.cnrs.fr"> CNRS</a> in February 2015,
        joining <a href="http://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr"> CRIStAL</a>
        at the University of Lille, France.
