      I am passionate about teaching. In 2016-2017, I am teaching </strong> two master-level courses</strong>:
      <ul>
          <li>
              <a href="../teaching/bnp.html"> Bayesian nonparametrics 101 </a> at ENSAE Paris. The objective is that students can read and understand recent advances in BNP research.
          </li>
          <li>
              <a href="../teaching/bankruptcy.html"> Machine learning applied to bankruptcy prediction</a> at Ecole Centrale de Lille. This course is built around an ML competition on bankruptcy prediction, and aims at preparing future data scientists to face the wild data world out there.
          </li>
      </ul>
