        Here is the material for the course given at ENSAE Paris in January 2017. I am a <a href="http://www.cnrs.fr/index.php"> CNRS</a>
	junior permanent researcher at University of Lille, France, working on
        <strong> computational statistics</strong>. My research
        interests include <strong>Monte Carlo methods</strong>,
        probabilistic <strong>modelling</strong>, <strong> machine learning</strong>,
        and <strong>applications</strong> to physics and biology.
        </p>

        <p> I am a member of team <a href="http://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?rubrique29&eid=30">
	SigMA</a> of <a href="http://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/?lang=en"> CRIStAL</a>,
	the department of computer science, signal processing and
	automatics.

        <p>
        <strong> News:</strong> I will be the PI of <strong>ANR grant BoB</strong>, to start in October 2016, on "Bayesian statistics for expensive models and tall data". </p>
