* Go to CRIStAL's intranet. Ask for access to "ressources informatiques". Needs team head's and lab head's signatures. Then should receive temporary credentials to access univ-lille services (mail, eduroam, Nextcloud, etc.).
* Ask Fatima Hammadi for a CMS form. CMS is your card for everything: access to buildings, cantine, etc. Once you get a CMS card, find its number on your [ENT](ent.univ-lille.fr), and go to Bruno Boursier with that number. He will give you access to the Esprit building and your office.
* GO to CRIStAL's intranet, and register your MAC address to get ethernet access.
