* Go to CRIStAL's intranet. Ask for access to "ressources informatiques". You will have to fill an online form that results in a pdf. Get the team head's (RÃ©mi Boyer) signature, and send the signed to form to Anne-Sophie Fardoux, who will get the signature of the lab's head (Olivier Colot). Within one or two days, you should receive temporary credentials to access univ-lille services (mail, eduroam, Nextcloud, etc.). You will also receive credientials for CRIStAL's intranet (at some point in the near future, both services should use the same credientials.
* Ask Fatima Hammadi for a CMS form. CMS is your card for everything: access to buildings, cantine, etc. Once you get a CMS card *and* you have your univ-lille credientials, find your CMS number number on your [ENT](ent.univ-lille.fr), and write to Bruno Boursier with that number, asking for access to Esprit and your office.
* GO to CRIStAL's intranet, and register your MAC address to get ethernet access.
* As you are on the intranet, check the process for CNRS "missions", you will have to make a "demande d'ordre de mission" each time you travel for work, then keep all receipts (food, hotel, transport), and go back to the grant's administrator with this to fill your "I'm back" form and get reimbursement.
* Ask Dominique Deremetz to add you to the RESEDA database. Once this is done, you will have access to the CNRS suite of tools to book flights/trains and hotels.
