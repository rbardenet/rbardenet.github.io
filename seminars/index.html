Abstract: Image forensics enjoys its increasing popularity as a powerful image authentication tool, working in a blind passive way without the aid of any a priori embedded information compared to fragile image watermarking. On its opponent side, image anti-forensics attacks forensic algorithms for the future development of more trustworthy forensics. This talk presents some contributions to both image anti-forensics and forensics. Firstly, we focus on targeted image anti-forensics, with the goal to disguise artifacts left by a known image operation. Different from existing image anti-forensic methods based on simple image processing, we design sophisticated but more effective anti-forensic methods, by leveraging on advanced concepts/methods from image restoration meanwhile with integration of anti-forensic strategies/terms. Following this proposed research line, this talk provides a novel JPEG compression anti-forensic method based on Total Variation based deblocking and assignment problem based perceptual DCT histogram smoothing. The problem of median filtered image quality enhancement and anti-forensics is also addressed and an image variational deconvolution framework is introduced. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by improvements in both forensic undetectability and image quality, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, previous experiences in defeating targeted forensic detectors motivate us to work towards general-purpose forensics. Most current forensic methods are very successful in detecting artifacts left by a targeted image operation, however may fail to detect a different image operation. Such a problem is challenging to solve but is important for moving forensics closer to real-world applications. Different from the probably only existing general-purpose forensics work based on steganalytic features, we compare likelihood values calculated under different natural image statistical models to perform forensics. Besides its effectiveness, this new forensic methodology can apply to various image operations, is conceptually simple, and does not need extraction of hand-crafted features. After presenting several contributions to anti-forensics and forensics on conventional images, the talk ends with the discussion of possible forensic problems and challenges introduced by the adoption of an increasingly popular imaging technique -- High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging.

             Abstract: The ability to decipher the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules at high resolution will greatly improve our understanding of the biological machinery. To this aim, X-ray crystallography has been used by scientists for several decades with tremendous results. This imaging method however requires a crystal to be grown, and for most interesting biomolecules (proteins, viruses) this may not be possible. The single-particle experiment was proposed to address these limitations, and the recent advent of ultra-bright X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) opens a new set of opportunities in biomolecular imaging. 

             In the single-particle experiment, thousands of diffraction patterns are recorded, where each image corresponds to an unknown, random orientation of individual copies of the biomolecule. These noisy unoriented diffraction patterns need to be then assembled in three-dimensional space to from the three-dimensional intensity function, which characterizes completely the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecule. 

             This work focuses on geometrical variations of an existing algorithm, the Expansion-Maximization-Compression (EMC) algorithm introduced by Loh and Elser. The algorithm relies upon an expectation-maximization method, by maximizing the likelihood of an intensity model with respect to the diffraction patterns. The contributions of this work are (i) the redefinition of the EMC algorithm in a spherical design, motivated by the intrinsic properties of the intensity function. (ii) the utilisation of an orthonormal harmonic basis on the three-dimensional ball which allows an efficient representation of the intensity function (iii) the scaling of the EMC parameters with the desired resolution, providing computational speed acceleration. (iv) the intensity estimation error dependence is analysed with respect to the EMC parameters.

        <strong> On Bayesian algorithms for sequential resource allocation.</strong>

            Abstract: We will discuss optimal strategies for sequential resource allocation, under the so-called stochastic multi-armed bandit model. In this model, an agent faces K unknown probability distributions, called arms. He sequentially draws samples from these arms, perceived as rewards, and his goal is to find a sequential sampling strategy maximizing the (expected) sum of rewards, or equivalently minimizing a quantity called regret. In a parametric setting, the regret can be viewed as a frequentist quantity, since it depends on the unknown parameters of the arms. However, we will see that strategies based on Bayesian tools, that exploit a posterior distribution over the parameters of the arms, perform really well with respect to the regret, and can even be shown to be (asymptotically) optimal.

            For Bayes-UCB, an algorithm based on posterior quantiles, and Thompson Sampling, based on posterior samples, I will present theoretical guarantees in simple models, and explain how the algorithms can be used in more complex models, like contextual bandit models (with application to recommender systems) or combinatorial bandits (with application to communication networks).
