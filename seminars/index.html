Abstract: Image forensics enjoys its increasing popularity as a powerful image authentication tool, working in a blind passive way without the aid of any a priori embedded information compared to fragile image watermarking. On its opponent side, image anti-forensics attacks forensic algorithms for the future development of more trustworthy forensics. This talk presents some contributions to both image anti-forensics and forensics. Firstly, we focus on targeted image anti-forensics, with the goal to disguise artifacts left by a known image operation. Different from existing image anti-forensic methods based on simple image processing, we design sophisticated but more effective anti-forensic methods, by leveraging on advanced concepts/methods from image restoration meanwhile with integration of anti-forensic strategies/terms. Following this proposed research line, this talk provides a novel JPEG compression anti-forensic method based on Total Variation based deblocking and assignment problem based perceptual DCT histogram smoothing. The problem of median filtered image quality enhancement and anti-forensics is also addressed and an image variational deconvolution framework is introduced. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by improvements in both forensic undetectability and image quality, compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, previous experiences in defeating targeted forensic detectors motivate us to work towards general-purpose forensics. Most current forensic methods are very successful in detecting artifacts left by a targeted image operation, however may fail to detect a different image operation. Such a problem is challenging to solve but is important for moving forensics closer to real-world applications. Different from the probably only existing general-purpose forensics work based on steganalytic features, we compare likelihood values calculated under different natural image statistical models to perform forensics. Besides its effectiveness, this new forensic methodology can apply to various image operations, is conceptually simple, and does not need extraction of hand-crafted features. After presenting several contributions to anti-forensics and forensics on conventional images, the talk ends with the discussion of possible forensic problems and challenges introduced by the adoption of an increasingly popular imaging technique -- High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging.
