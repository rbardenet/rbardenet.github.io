                Starting on 29 February 2016, SigMA seminars are now announced on the <a href="http://seminaire.univ-lille1.fr/taxonomy/term/3"> ADSL</a> platform that Ben Guedj (Inria and Painlev√©) and I are setting up with the help of the Centre for computing resources (CRI) of Univ. Lille. Currently, the platform is in its testing phase and is only accessible using Shibboleth, but it will shortly become public.
