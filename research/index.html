        <strong> Markov chain Monte Carlo</strong> algorithms are
popular methods.

        A <strong> determinantal point process</strong> is a
        distribution over clouds of points, where the points repell
        each other. Realizations typically look like well-spread point
        patterns. DPPs have strangely appeared in various domains,
such as quantum physics, random matrix theory, or number
theory. Recently, they have appeared in stats, and I am investigating
their use.
